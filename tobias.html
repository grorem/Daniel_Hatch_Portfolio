                        <h4>Tobias Frere-Jones</h4> Daniel Hatch<br><br>

                        <p>I had hoped to meet Tobias while researching at the Frick in New York City this summer.
As I finished up my monthly “Where are you at” call with Natalia Ilyin (my faculty advisor
at VCFA) on the front steps of the Frick Library, she commented that I should go see
Tobias Frere-Jones, because he had an office down on Broadway. So Natalia introduced
me to Tobias, unfortunately we were not able to meet because of prior commitments.
Interested in getting to know Tobias, but with a clear goal of asking biographical
questions about Alan Meeks, I sent him an email.</p>

<p>Born in New York in 1970, Tobias’ spent his childhood at dockyards in Brooklyn and art
galleries, seeing the art and typefaces on signs and buildings. This cacophony of visual
stimulation during his formative years may have been his research for what would
become his vocation. He started to paint at the age of 14, but in high school type drew
him in. Literally - he started to draw & design the font Armada before he graduated. His
father, a writer in advertising and his mother, a print production artist, made designing
type a natural direction for him. In an April 2013 interview he commented “I was aware
that somewhere in this sequence that my parents were a part of somebody draws the
letters. I couldn’t imagine who would want to do that.”</p>

<p>Growing up in the midst of the publishing world of New York, provided many
opportunities to immerse him in typography. Which is evident with the many
publications for which he has designed type. For an example, Griffith Gothic was a
revived type from the 1937 Mergenthaler designs, which he designed for Fast Company.
Globe Century was designed for the Boston Globe in 1995. Surveyor & Archer were types
commissioned by Martha Stewart Living magazine. Even Wired used Vitesse and
commissioned additional weights for the magazine’s redesign. In 2001 the Wall Street
Journal asked Hoefler & Frere-Jones to design a typeface for displaying financial tables
in the paper. It seems that living in big cities in the east coast afforded a lot of
opportunities to be immersed in type.</p>

<p>Tobias’ encyclopedic knowledge of typography history was so compelling to me. He
seemed to be looking over new and ancient type specimens, which friends would call his
attention to. He also traveled to Amsterdam and other parts of Europe seeking out these
examples of type. In 1991 he designed a font on a napkin for his brothers band. Later
while in the Netherlands, he showed his font to Erik Spiekermann at Font-Shop.
“Reluctantly I showed him this other thing [Delores], a joke I had drawn on a bar napkin.
To my total surprise, he ran out of the room and came back with contracts to sell it
through FontFont.”</p>

<p>While at RISD, Tobias studied typography mostly on his own, due to the lack of qualified
type design faculty. There he delved into the aspects of readability of typefaces.

Experimenting with many different ideas, that ranged from using Pythagoras’ theorem
to relating Tesla’s work with electricity.</p>

<p>His first experimental typeface in 1992 was Cassandra. He was trying to create noise in
the reading process to study the effects of obstructing the typeface. He used his font
Garage Gothic and moved they type horizontally from the base then wrapping the
bottom of the font over the top. While most of the shapes are there, it becomes difficult
to read because you mind has to travel up and down putting the characters together.</p>
