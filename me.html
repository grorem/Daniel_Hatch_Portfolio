                        <h4>Teaching Philosophy</h4>Daniel Hatch<br><br>

                        <p>My philosophy of teaching has developed over the years of being a student and teacher
alike. Several years ago it became apparent that I wanted to use my experience in
graphic design to teach. The classes I have taught have been exciting to me. Almost
electric when I see the pupils eyes open wide with understanding. That is probably one
of the most rewarding parts of teaching</p>


<p>My teaching philosophy starts with the idea that teaching is mutual relationship between
the student and instructor. I will respect the students and expect their mutual respect.
The learning process will go both ways - we will both learn and grow in the graphic
design experience.</p>

<p>Next I have a firm believe of teaching by doing. Experience helps solidify the knowledge.
Humans are naturally creative, we just have to overcome the fear that we gained in early
school. We fear to fail, but failure is one of the best teachers. We learn a great deal from
our failures.</p>

<p>I firmly believe in having a passion for the subject you teach. Being passionate about
design has made a change my level of enjoyment positively, as I have been a student
and teacher. This excitement in teaching helps the students stay engaged. It also means
that I am constantly improving my skills and graphic design pedagogy.</p>

<p>My role as a teacher is to facilitate the students ability to “see” more clearly. The study of
graphic design is understanding why we create “Art”. Most students may end up in just a
job, but if they can see clearly they can make more meaning in their life. Being
passionate about design has served me well. Not only do I enjoy my work, I am a better
designer because I am not just working for the weekend.</p>

<p>When teaching college classes, it has become apparent that the action of doing is much
more memorable for the students, then the lecture. Going through the design process
from brainstorm, sketches, and comping with the students helps to solidify the creative
process in their work. I also enjoy this process as it helps them to realize that they are
truly creative.</p>
