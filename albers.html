                        <h4>The Box in the Library</h4> Daniel Hatch<br><br>

                        <p>I stumble upon this box by accident. Struggling to find pertinent research to study at the
Frick in New York, I had leaped into this adventure before I looked, hoping I would find
something, and with the plane ticket bought before I knew if the Frick Library was even
open at that time, I perused their online catalog. I had discovered earlier that the
Cooper-Hewitt had been closed for repairs, so I thought I need to prepare better for my
research trip to New York.</p>

<p>I found the Frick online catalog difficult to search through and that there were very few
images to evaluate the catalog entries. I had come across some books on Eric Gill, but I
felt I seen too much of his work, and I needed to branch out. So after searching for
Morrison, and Eric Gill, I stumbled across Josef Albers. I knew him only as they guy who
wrote “The Interaction of Color”. I had purchased a black and white version for
undergraduate school to save money as a starving student, but I had never really
thought much about him. Intrigued that the catalog had indicated that a box of his
writings, woodcuts, prints, and other documents resided at the Frick Reference Library.</p>

<p>When I arrived at the Frick, not sure what I would do with my daughter Emilee, who had
accompanied me, I asked if she could stay with me. The library had a strict policy of only
letting adults into the library, but fortunately a charming young lady acquiesced to my
request to have my research assitant come into the library with me. So we entered an
ancient elevator and ascended to the 3rd floor to the reading room.</p>

<p>I didn’t initially understand where this box came from with the Josef Albers papers, but I
received an email from Shannon Morelli, the archivist who I worked with there, which
entailed the origin of the box. On August 26, 1946, Josef Albers had written several
museums to ask if they were interested in prints and other documents related to his
teaching and his wife’s work (strangely I received these documents on August 26, 2013).
He wrote from the Black Mountain College in North Carolina. Again in 1954 when Albers
had moved to Yale, he had more materials to update the collection at the Frick. Again in
1958, 1960 and 1961 he sent more materials. It seems unlikely that Josef Albers had been
self obsessed. So he must have had a genuine desire to enlarge the art community with
his teaching efforts.</p>

<p>Transcripts of some of his talks seem to give the indication that he was not full of
himself. “He who is and remains a student himself is justified to teach students.... How
can we develop others when our own growth is arrested? If growth is the aim and the
measure of development on the teachers’ as well as the students’ side, it is also its
excitement without which teaching is only a hard job and a sour bread.” - Josef Albers</p>

<p>Later in August, I received some of the scans I had requested from the Frick. It had come
view project
from another department other than Shannon’s archives where I had found the box of
Josef Albers papers. It was one of several books I had found of his in the library section.
Two of these books caught my attention. Josef Albers Art as Experience and Josef
Albers To Open Eyes. I think that maybe what I have been coming to terms with is how I
expect to teach Graphic Design.</p>

<p>Maybe the bigger question is why should I teach? Is it purely to fill up my time? Am I
yearning to make a difference in this industry I have devoted some 25 years of my life</p>
