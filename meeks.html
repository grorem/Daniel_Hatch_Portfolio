                        <h4>Alan Meeks, Typographic Artist</h4> Daniel Hatch<br><br>

                        <p>I became interested in Alan Meeks’ typographic work as I researched the letter “Q” in
roman typefaces. As I annotated the typefaces I was studying, I had discovered he had
designed many of the familiar fonts that I was familiar with from my college days (e.g.
VAG round, Brickley Script, Jazz, Plaza, Algerian, Cabaret, and Belwe). My initial research
yielded very little biographical information about Alan. This utter lack of content on him
intrigued me, with most of the information I found a reworked of Alan Meeks’ website
verbiage. Several books seemed to mention people around him, but he was seemingly
left out of typographic history. After a fairly library exhaustive library search, I decided I
had to contact the designer, with hopes that he could direct me to a book, or biography
about him. With that first email to the contact me address on his website, it started our
correspondence over email.</p>

<p>Alan Meeks was born in 1951, to a stay at home ‘mum’ and an accountant father at the
News of the World. He grew up with one brother, a fairly famous sports photographer in
the UK. It was an auspicious start to Alan’s life. Neither of his parents were artistic, but
that didn’t seem to inhibit Alan from being creative.</p>

<p>Captivated from the age of three by Walt Disney cartoons, Alan held up Walt Disney as
an “overwhelming influence and inspiration”. He would draw Disney characters as a kid,
although he reflected back that the drawings were not very good. What he came to
admired about Walt Disney was the uncompromising quality of everything he produced.
“no theme park will ever rival Disneyworld, Walt let nothing go out until he was
completely satisfied with it regardless of the cost. Perfection was far more important
than profit, and I felt everything was produced for the enjoyment of the customer and
not the financial gain for the producer.”</p>

<p>He went to Lister technical college and in 1969 at the age of 18 started working for
Graphic Systems, a rival to Letraset for transfer products. There he learned to cut
rubylith film from Gary Gillot, their “best instructor in stencil cutting”. His technique
copied the Japanese style of brush lettering. He would move the rubylith film with one
hand, while cutting film with a stencil knife in the other hand. Both the paper and the
knife were moving at the same time. “Gary taught me to consider the method of stencil
cutting and its results as artwork and not simply a technical process.”</p>

<p>Graphic Systems could be classified as a frugal company. They required the stencil
cutters to use every available scrap of Ulano (rubylith), so they would use the insides of
large capital letters to cut smaller letters. With high pressure to complete work quickly,
Alan had come into work after an injury with both hands in bandages, and his
co-workers taped a stencil knife to his hand, so he could work.</p>

<p>At the age of 23 he left and started at the Letraset type studio (known originally for
their rub-on lettering for paste-up in advertising). Letraset had a much more generous
time allowance for artwork, a reprieve from his previous working conditions. He worked
in the design studio which consisted of 2 people in London with the manufacturing
facility in Ashford, Kent (100 miles outside of London). The design staff in London grew
to 6 or 7 people. Alan had a good relationship with his former co-workers and regularly
gets together with them.</p>
