                        <h4>Arthur Eric Freaking Gill</h4> Daniel Hatch<br><br>

                        <p>Originally, I discovered Eric Gill at the Wolfsonian museum on a hot muggy summer day
in Miami. This was not a typical summer break, as I spent my time in the archive library,
due remodeling at the Wolfsonian for the fall show. The illustrated “Four Gospels” had
caught my eye in FIU online catalog. Little did I know that Eric Gill would haunt me for
the rest of the semester. I gazed over page after page of illustrated type and woodcuts.
Enthralled by hundreds of illustrated paragraphs in this aged tome. </p>

<p>Now, I asked “Who was this guy?” Several articles and the biography by Fiona
MacCarthy, characterized Eric Gill as a pervert. How could I believe that this man
who seem to understand the bible in a way that his “N” hooked a fish properly
placed in the context of the bible passage, this was not the profile of a pervert,
but a craftsman and artist unequaled in his day. </p>

<p>Eric was born in 1882 to a devoutly religious family, with his father Reverend Author
Tiddman Gill a congregationalist minister and his mother Rose who took care of their
rather large family of thirteen children. The children were expected to work hard, as they
were not rich and rarely had servants in the house. Shortly after Eric’s birth, his father
left his ministry and became a clergyman of ‘the Countess of Huntingdon’s Connection’.1
This obscure sect of Calvinist Methodist seemed to represent a pattern that Eric Gill
would follow in his life of leaving one residence after another. His father later left that
church and returned again to the Church of England.</p>

<p>Eric Gill would reject his religion of his nativity and join one that would better suit his
needs. So in 1913 he joined the Catholic church, but he was not a faithful member. This
was evidenced by his sexual misconduct extending to prostitutes, many sexual partners,
his sister and even his own daughters. Mary his wife seemed complicit as she could not
be blind to this behavior. As the epitome of hedonism in the waning days of Victorian
society, Eric Gill recorded his sexual behavior meticulous in his journals.</p>

<p>Although Eric Gill’s behavior cast a dark shadow on his work, I had to look past this and
marvel - this guy had skills. A master stone mason, typographer, designer and
woodcutter, and I can’t look at Gill Sans in my font menu without thinking of his mastery
of typography. No other artist or craftsmen in his day rivaled his skill in so many different
fields of design.</p>

<p>Eric Gill would reject his religion of his nativity and join one that would suit his needs. So
in 1913 he joined the Catholic church, but he was not what I would call faithful. Although
he seemed tobe devout, his sexual misconduct extended through prostitutes, many
sexual partners (many whom seemingly his wife Ethel was aware of), as well as his own
sister and daughters. He seemed to be the epitome of hedonism in the waning days of
view project
Victorian society. He was very meticulous about keeping a record of his life and sexual
activities in his journals.</p>

<p>With that off my chest, I endeavor to look at Eric Gill a little more objectively. So as I sat
in the Wolfsonian, I was struck by the sheer volume of illustrations and letter forms that
were scattered sometimes on every page of the illustrated Four Gospels. In 1931 he
illustrated hundreds of pages, and set the illustrations and the type together. Page after
page has his illustrations which flow beautifully into the paragraphs or the text. He also</p>
